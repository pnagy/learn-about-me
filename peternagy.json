    "Introduction": "I am the creator of this site which is for demonstration purposes only. My goal was to have a cool CV-like introduction page and during this process I wanted to learn some new technologies. So learn about me: I am an almost 28 years old software engineer who passionately likes writing code, solving problems and connecting things. I like experiencing with and trying out new tools and technologies following the trends. I believe softwares should make people's life easier and our task is to find the best available tools to achive this. So I don't stick to any programming language or technology. Any of them can be learnt and has its place. However my favorite playground is frontend developing. I like seeing the results my work inmediately and working hereby with quick iterations. I enjoy discovering the newest packages or the coolest plugins or widgets.",
